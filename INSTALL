Once all dependencies have been installed, the MFC can be built via

    $$ make

from the MFC directory. This will build all MFC components. Individual
components can be built via

    $$ make [component]

where [component] is one of "pre_process,simulation,post_process". 

Once this is completed, you can ensure that the software is working 
as intended by running

    $$ make test
