#> Simulations using MFC depend upon Python, MPI,
#> and FFTW.

## Python ##
If you do not have Python, it can be installed via 
Homebrew on OSX (https://www.brew.sh) as:
    $$ brew install python
or compiled via your favorite package manager on Unix 
systems.

## MPI ##
An MPI fortran compiler is required for all systems.
If you do not have one, Homebrew can take care of this
on OSX:
    $$ brew install open-mpi
or compiled via another package manager on Unix systems.

## FFTW ##
If you already have FFTW compiled:
    - Specify the location of your FFTW library and 
    include files in Makefile.user (fftw_lib_dir and
    fftw_include_dir)

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you do not have FFTW compiler, the library and 
=======
If you do not have FFTW compiled, the library and 
>>>>>>> MFC_private/master
installer are included in this package. Just:
    $$ cd installers
    $$ ./install_fftw.sh

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
## LAPACK ##
If you already have LAPACK compiled:
    - Specify the location of your LAPACK library and 
    include files in Makefile.user (lapack_lib_dir) 

If you do not have LAPACK compiled, the library and 
installer are included in this package. Just:
    $$ cd installers
    $$ ./install_lapack.sh

>>>>>>> MFC_private/master
#> Post-processing of parallel data files is not required,
#> but can indeed be handled with the MFC. For this, HDF5
#> and Silo must be installed

On OSX, a custom tap for Silo is included in the installers
directory. You can use it via
    $$ cd lib
    $$ brew install silo.rb
This will install silo and its dependences (including HDF5)
in their usual locations (/usr/local/lib and 
/usr/local/include) 

On Unix systems, you can install via a package manager or
from source. On CentOS (also Windows 7), HDF5
binaries can be found at 
    https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current18/bin/
Untar this archive in your intended location via 
    $$ tar -zxf [your HDF5 archive]

Silo should be downloaded at
    https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/silo/downloads
then 
    $$ tar -zxf [your Silo archive]
    $$ cd [your Silo archive]
    $$ ./configure --prefix=[target installation directory] --enable-pythonmodule --enable-optimization --disable-hzip --disable-fpzip --enableportable-binary FC=mpif90 F77=mpif77 -with-hdf5=[your hdf5 directory]/include,/[your hdf5 directory]/lib --disable-silex
    $$ make
    $$ make install
then add this line to your ~/.bash_profile
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/[your silo directory]/lib:/[your hdf5 directory]/lib
and
    $$ source ~/.bash_profile

You will then need to modify silo_lib_dir and silo_include_dir in 
Makefile.user to point to your silo directory
