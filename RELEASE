-- Version 1.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------

We introduce the MFC (multi-component flow code), a CFD-framework for
simulation of compressible, multi-component fluid flows. It has been developed
by the Computational Flow Physics group at the California Institute of
Technology under the guidance of Professor Tim Colonius. The philosophy adopted
for the MFC began as early as with Eric Johnsen in 2006 [Johnsen and Colonius,
JCP 2006], though the principal architecture was developed by Vedran Coralic
[Coralic and Colonius, JCP 2014]. The accuracy and capabilities of the MFC has
been demonstrated through problems including shock-induced collapse of a gas
bubble in a liquid confined in a deformable vessel, that was used to predict
the cavitation-induced damage potential on blood vessel wall in the human body
during shock-wave lithotripsy [Coralic and Colonius, EJMF-B 2013]. The MFC has
subsequently been extended and modernized to simulate various other problems
including shock-induced droplet breakup [Meng and Colonius JFM 2016, 2018],
one-way acoustic generation [Maeda and Colonius 2017], violent collapse of gas
bubbles [Veilleux (Caltech thesis) 2019, Schmidmayer, Bryngelson, Colonius
ArXiv 2019], and cavitating flows [Bryngelson, Schmidmayer, Colonius IJMF
2019]. The release of the MFC is aimed at providing a unified platform on which
end-users can access the code and participate in its development for further
enhancement and modification. The MFC is licensed under the GNU GPLv3.
